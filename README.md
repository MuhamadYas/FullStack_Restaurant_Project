Typical Workflow
Registration / Sign‑in – When a customer visits the site they can browse as a guest or log in. New users can create an account by entering their details; these are validated and stored in the database.

Order placement & search – After logging in (or continuing as guest), the user heads to the menu. They can browse categories or use the search bar to find a specific dish; results are displayed in a table for easy comparison.

Checkout – Once the order is composed, the user selects whether they will pick up or eat at the restaurant and chooses a payment method (cash or credit). The order is confirmed and stored in the system.
